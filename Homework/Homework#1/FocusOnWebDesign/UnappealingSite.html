           This page is unappealing the 3 reasons why they are appealing are:
           <ul>
            <li>The Color scheme is unpleasant to look at.</li>
            <li>The page is not organized, and the navigation is complex.</li>
            <li>The page includes distracting picture that does not work with the site.</li>
        </ul>

        </p></dd>

            I would change the background to a simple color and to make the website easier to navigate for audiences to access.
