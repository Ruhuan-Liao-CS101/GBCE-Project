        <td>
            Like the flower itself, the history of the rose is very colorful. 
            Roses have been naturally growing for over 35 million years! 
            However, they were not known to be cultivated until about 5,000 years ago. 
            Their usage began not just as a decorative touch to one’s home, 
            but they were also used for medicinal purposes, to make perfumes, 
            and their petals were even used as confetti for festive occasions.

        <tr>
        <td>Carnation</td>
        <td>
            Carnations come in 3 different types: large flowered carnations, spray carnations, 
            and dwarf flowered carnations. Large flowered carnations can grow to 
            over 20 inches high with one large bloom per stem. These are also referred 
            to as the florist’s carnation. Spray and dwarf carnations have smaller 
            blooms but have multiple blooms per stem. These carnations grow to 12 inches 
            and are more commonly found in gardens. When planting carnations take care to 
            plant in a well-draining soil and in an area with ample sunlight.

        <tr>
        <td>Lavender</td>
        <td>
            More than 40 species are native to areas surrounding the Mediterranean 
            and are semi-evergreen perennials or sub-shrubs with gray-green, hairy, 
            linear leaves and purple, violet, lavender, or pinkish-white flowers. 
            Tiny glands on the flowers, leaves, and stems of the plant produce 
            the scented oil that is used in perfumes, bath preparations, lavender water, 
            and in aromatherapy to relieve stress and anxiety and bring about sleep. 
            Lavender is also prized as a flavoring in cooking, as an ingredient in teas, 
            and for a monofloral honey.
